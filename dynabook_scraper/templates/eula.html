            <li><strong>Toshiba Service Station</strong>
                <p>
                    By automatically bringing you the latest Software updates and alerts, Toshiba Service Station (TSS)
                    is the easiest way to keep your hardware product running smoothly. TSS allows your PC to
                    automatically search for Software updates/alerts from TOSHIBA that are specific to your PC. On the
                    initial Internet connection and periodically thereafter, your PC will automatically send TOSHIBA
                    limited system information (e.g., the Model, Part Number, Serial Number, OS version and/or initial
                    date of hardware boot etc.). TSS provides hardware diagnostic and troubleshooting functions and
                    services. The diagnostic or troubleshooting activity log is stored on the hard drive. If the "Send
                    diagnostic and troubleshooting log data" is enabled, the logs will be sent to TOSHIBA periodically.
                    This transmission is completely anonymous, no personally identifiable information is collected. This
                    transmission is different from product registration. Periodically, the PC scans TOSHIBA servers for
                    updates/alerts based on your system information. A notice window gives the option to apply or
                    decline the updates. TOSHIBA logs updates/alerts offered and installed on your hardware as part of
                    TOSHIBA's quality assurance program. TSS can be uninstalled from [Apps & features] in Windows
                    Settings. Thereafter, the hardware will not communicate with TOSHIBA and notices of updates and
                    automatic updates will cease. Please be advised, once TSS has been uninstalled you will no longer be
                    notified of updates or alerts, and future performance may be affected.</p>

                <p>TOSHIBA may use the information for technical support services, quality assurance analysis, and may
                    share it with TOSHIBA's World Wide Support organization or other third parties or affiliated TOSHIBA
                    companies engaged by TOSHIBA for the purposes of rendering such services.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation and Disassembly.</strong>

                    that such activity constitutes a fair use under applicable copyright law, or has a legitimate

                under the laws and regulations of the United States and other countries, including but not limited to
                the United States Export Administration Regulations, or any other applicable law, regulation or order

                directly or indirectly, in contravention of the Export laws.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.</strong> The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
                International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to the
                Software.

                <p><strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong> TACS endeavors to resolve customer disputes in a fair and
                    professional manner. In the unlikely event that TACS is unable to resolve a dispute, You and TACS
                    agree to resolve any Claims between us only by <strong>BINDING ARBITRATION</strong> except as
                    otherwise provided in the "Exceptions" paragraph below. For the purposes of this Dispute Resolution
                    Section, references to "TACS" mean Toshiba America Client Solutions, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries
                    and affiliates, and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents, beneficiaries,
                    predecessors in interest, successors, assigns and suppliers, references to "You" include all those
                    in privity with You, including Your family members, beneficiaries, and assigns, and references to
                    "Claim" shall include any dispute, claim or controversy arising from or relating to: (1) any product
                    or service governed by this EULA, including advertising for the product or service, whether based in
                    contract, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal or
                    equitable theory; (2) this EULA; and (3) the subject of any purported class action litigation in
                    which you are not a member of a certified class.</p>

                <p><strong>ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU AND TACS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO
                    PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong> The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined
                    Arbitration Rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to
                    as the "JAMS Rules") and under the rules set forth in this section. The JAMS Rules are available
                    online at jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules
                    and the rules set forth in this section, the rules set forth in this section will govern. <strong>This
                        Dispute Resolution agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and, thus, the
                        Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.</strong>
                    The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Dispute Resolution Section. To start an arbitration,
                    You or TACS must: (1) Write a Demand for Arbitration (see copy at www.jamsadr.com). The Demand must
                    include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You may, in
                    arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to You pursuant to Your state's law, (2)
                    Send three copies of the Demand, plus the appropriate filing fee, to: <strong>JAMS, 500 North State
                        College Blvd., 14th Floor, Orange, CA 92868 (1-800-352-5267)</strong>, and (3) Send one copy of
                    the Demand to the other party.</strong></p>

                <p>Fees/Costs. After receipt of Your arbitration notice, TACS will promptly reimburse You for Your
                    arbitration filing fee unless You seek more than $75,000 in damages, in which case, the payment of
                    these fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, TACS will
                    pay all JAMS administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the
                    notice requirements herein. Other fees, such as attorneys' fees and expenses of travel to the
                    arbitration, will be paid in accordance with the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds either the
                    substance of Your Claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper
                    purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the
                    payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. In such a situation, You agree to reimburse
                    TACS for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise Your obligation to pay under the
                    JAMS Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, TACS waives any rights TACS may have under the
                    JAMS Rules to seek attorneys' fees and costs from You if TACS prevails in the arbitration.</p>

                <p>Hearings and Location. If Your claim is for $10,000 or less, You may choose to have the arbitration
                    conducted solely on the basis of (1) documents submitted to the arbitrator, (2) through a telephonic
                    hearing, or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If Your claim exceeds
                    $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. Any in-person arbitration
                    hearings will be held at a location in the county (or parish) of Your residence unless You and TACS
                    both agree to another location or TACS agrees to a telephonic arbitration.</p>

                <p><strong>Arbitrator's Decision.</strong> (1) All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that
                    issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to
                    decide. (2) Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall
                    issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
                    which the award is based. (3) The arbitrator's decision is final and binding on all parties and may
                    be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. (4) The arbitrator may award
                    declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
                    the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. (5) <strong>YOU
                        AND TACS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR TACS' INDIVIDUAL
                        CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
                        PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both You and TACS agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                    consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                    representative or class proceeding. Accordingly, You and TACS agree that the JAMS Class Action
                    Procedures do not apply to this arbitration. If this specific provision (5) is found to be
                    unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution agreement shall be null and void.</p>

                <p><strong>Exceptions.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual
                    action in small claims court. The arbitration provision above also does not preclude You from
                    bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law
                    allows, seek relief against TACS on Your behalf.</p></li>
